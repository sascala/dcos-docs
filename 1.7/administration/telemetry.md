To continuously improve the DC/OS experience, we have included a telemetry component that reports anonymous usage data back to us. We use this data to monitor the reliability of core DC/OS components, installations, and to find out which features are most popular. There are two sections that have the telemetry component implemented:

## System

You will see a ping to `segment.com` once per hour with this data:

Along with the health of each system component in your cluster, this also tells us which version you are running.

## User Interface

When using the DC/OS UI, we receive two types of notifications:

- Login information
- The pages you’ve viewed while navigating the UI


## Opt-Out

You can opt-out of providing anonymous data by disabling telemetry for your cluster. To disable telemetry, add this parameter to your [`config.yaml`][4] file during installation (note this requires using the [CLI][1] or [advanced][2] installers):

```yaml
telemetry_enabled: 'false'
```

Note that if you’ve already installed your cluster and would like to disable this in-place, you can go through an [upgrade][3] with the same parameter set.
